# EIDOS interpreter
-------------------
Edit program in parser.py (future: allow for input programs)
Run
```
python3 generator.py
```

## Running a suite of tests
---------------------------
To run a bunch of Eidos files at once place them in a directory containing only
Eidos files. Then edit the `testCases.py` file's testDir variable. You can then
run
```
python3 testCases.py
```
and the program will display the output of each file and at the end will report
the number of failed programs out of the total number of programs that were run.


Note: The pass rate that is shown only shows programs that do not error out. 
It does not show that the programs have the correct output.
